It seems there might be a typo in your query. I assume you meant "Microservice Modernization Patterns" related to the process of updating or transforming existing applications into a microservices architecture. If that's the case, here are some common patterns used during the modernization of monolithic applications into microservices:

Strangler Pattern:

Gradually replace components of the monolithic application with microservices over time.
New features and functionalities are implemented as microservices, while the monolith is still responsible for the existing functionality.
Over time, the monolith is "strangled" as more and more functionality is moved to microservices.
Decomposition Pattern:

Identify cohesive modules or bounded contexts within the monolithic application and extract them into separate microservices.
This pattern involves breaking down the monolith into smaller, more manageable services based on business capabilities.
Database Per Service:

Move from a shared database used by the monolith to a database per microservice model.
Each microservice manages its own database, ensuring data isolation and autonomy.
API Gateway:

Introduce an API gateway to handle requests from clients and route them to the appropriate microservices.
The API gateway also provides features like authentication, rate limiting, and caching.
Event-Driven Architecture:

Implement an event-driven approach where microservices communicate through asynchronous events and messaging.
Events enable loose coupling and scalability between microservices.
Service Discovery:

Introduce a service registry to facilitate service discovery among microservices.
Microservices can dynamically locate and communicate with each other without hardcoding IP addresses or endpoints.
DevOps and CI/CD:

Adopt DevOps practices to streamline the development, deployment, and monitoring of microservices.
Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for faster and automated deployments.
Feature Flags:

Gradually enable or disable features using feature flags.
This allows you to experiment with new features in production without impacting users.
Polyglot Persistence:

Use different types of databases optimized for specific microservices' data needs.
Each microservice may use the most suitable database type for its requirements.
Observability and Monitoring:

Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability to track the performance and health of microservices.
Tools like distributed tracing, logging, and metrics are essential for identifying issues and maintaining service quality.
These patterns can be combined and adapted to suit the specific requirements and challenges of modernizing a monolithic application into a microservices architecture. It's crucial to carefully plan and execute the migration, as well as continuously monitor the system's performance and stability during and after the modernization process.
