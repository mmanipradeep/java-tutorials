Observer is behavioural design pattern

1. What  is observer pattern ?

According to GoF definition, observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
It is also referred to as the publish-subscribe pattern.


Observable is an object  which notifies observers  about the changes inthe  state.

To be able to do that, the observable object needs to keep references to the observers,
